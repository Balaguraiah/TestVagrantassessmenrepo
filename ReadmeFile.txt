README.md (Instructions):

Clone or download the code repository to your local machine.

Make sure you have Java and TestNg set up on your system.

Open the project in your preferred Java development environment (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, etc.).

Execute the tests:

Run the RecentlyPlayedStoreTest class as JUnit tests. You should see the test cases execute and validate the logic of the RecentlyPlayedStore class.

The tests should pass, demonstrating that the recently played songs are managed correctly, and the least recently played songs are removed when the store reaches its capacity.
